**Wine Quality Prediction Project**


*Project Overview*

This project aims to predict the quality of red wine based on its physicochemical properties using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. By analyzing the wine’s features, such as acidity, pH, residual sugar, and alcohol content, we can identify which factors most influence the quality score, offering insights useful for both wine producers and enthusiasts.

*Dataset*

The dataset used in this project contains chemical properties and quality ratings for various red wine samples.

*Project Workflow*

The following steps outline the approach used in this project:

1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Handling missing values (if any).
Removing outliers and transforming skewed data.
Normalizing or standardizing feature values to improve model performance.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Univariate Analysis: Visualizations of each attribute to understand distributions.
Bivariate Analysis: Scatterplots and heatmaps to explore relationships between variables.
Feature Selection: Identifying the most impactful features on wine quality using correlation analysis.
3. Model Training
Feature Engineering: Transforming data into a format suitable for machine learning.
Model Selection: Various regression/classification models were tested (e.g., linear regression, decision trees).
Model Evaluation: Models were evaluated using accuracy and other relevant metrics to select the best-performing model.
4. Results and Analysis
Insights into which chemical features influence wine quality.
Recommendations for potential quality improvements in wine production based on findings.


*Project Results*


This project demonstrates how different chemical properties can significantly impact wine quality. For instance, higher alcohol content and specific acidity levels were among the top factors positively correlated with quality scores. The model predictions can guide winemakers in refining their processes for higher-quality wine.


*Future Work*


Explore more advanced models like Random Forests or Gradient Boosting for improved accuracy.
Investigate additional factors or use external data to enhance predictions.
